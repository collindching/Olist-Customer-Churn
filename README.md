# Olist-Customer-Churn

Customer churn problems can be parsed in to contractual or non-contractual. When business is contractual, you have a supervised binary classification problem. In the non-contractual setting, you have an unobserved probabilistic problem. 

In this project, I modeled non-contractual customer churn in Python, using the Lifetimes implementation of BG/NBD.
